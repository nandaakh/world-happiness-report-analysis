# world-happiness-report-analysis
 The "World Happiness Report Analysis" project is an analysis that aims to study and analyze world happiness reports from various countries around the world. Using data from the World Happiness Report, this project presents research on the factors that contribute to people's happiness in various countries.  In this project, we conducted a comprehensive data exploration using informative statistical analysis and data visualization techniques. We identify and compare the main factors that affect happiness levels between countries, such as economic factors, health, education, freedom, and social support.  The project also provides in-depth insight into happiness trends around the world over a period of time. We analyze changes in happiness scores from year to year and identify differences and similarities between developed and developing countries in terms of people's happiness.  Through clear and concise visualizations, this project aims to provide a deeper understanding of happiness as an indicator of quality of life in different countries. We hope that the findings and insights generated in this project can become a reference and source of knowledge for researchers, decision makers, and other interested parties to understand more about the factors that influence happiness at the global level.
